# What is Humane Engineering?

It is getting the basics right.

We demand the following:

* Clearly defined interpersonal boundaries and respectful communication at all times.
* Product and platform boundaries.
* High quality software through tests, automation, repeatable (immutable) infrastructure and pipelines.
* Aiming for zero downtime and on-call time through good architectural and technical decisions.
